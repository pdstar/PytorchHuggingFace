# PyTorch and HuggingFace scavenger hunt!
PyTorch and HuggingFace have emerged as powerful tools for developing and deploying neural networks.

In this scavenger hunt, we will explore the capabilities of PyTorch and HuggingFace, uncovering hidden treasures on the way.

We have two parts:

Familiarize yourself with PyTorch
Get to know HuggingFace
Familiarize yourself with PyTorch
Learn the basics of PyTorch, including tensors, neural net parts, loss functions, and optimizers. This will provide a foundation for understanding and utilizing its capabilities in developing and training neural networks.

PyTorch tensors
Scan through the PyTorch tensors documentation here. Be sure to look at the examples.

In the following cell, create a tensor named my_tensor of size 3x3 with values of your choice. The tensor should be created on the GPU if available. Print the tensor.
